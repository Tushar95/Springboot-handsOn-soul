# Spring Boot Soul Project (Java 21 + Gradle Kotlin DSL)

🚀 A **minimal Spring Boot template** written in **Java 21** with **Gradle Kotlin DSL**.
This repository acts as a **soul/base project**, from which forks and feature branches can be created for experimenting with or implementing new functionalities.

Example:

* Fork this project → create a branch for `resilience4j` → implement fault tolerance patterns.
* Another fork → create a branch for `Spring Cloud Gateway` → implement API Gateway.

This approach helps maintain a **clean lifecycle for learning and prototyping enterprise features**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Java 21** (LTS, latest production-ready version)
* **Spring Boot 3.x**
* **Gradle Kotlin DSL** (modern build tool with type-safe configs)
* **Dependencies**:

  * `spring-boot-starter-actuator` → Health checks, metrics, monitoring
  * `spring-boot-devtools` → Hot reload for faster development
  * `lombok` → Cleaner code with annotations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Java 21** installed
* **Gradle 8+** (optional, can also use wrapper `./gradlew`)

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/soul-project.git
cd soul-project
```

### Build & Run

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Application will start at:
👉 `http://localhost:8080`

## 🔄 Branching Strategy

This repo acts as a **base project**.
To add features, **fork → branch → implement → document**.

Example workflow:

```bash
# Create a new fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/soul-project.git
cd soul-project

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/resilience4j

# Implement resilience4j
# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Added resilience4j integration"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/resilience4j
```

## 🌱 Possible Forks (Learning Paths)

You can fork this soul project and add:

* 🔐 **Resilience4j** → Circuit Breakers, Rate Limiters, Retries
* ☁️ **Spring Cloud Gateway** → API Gateway, routing
* 📡 **Spring Security** → JWT, OAuth2
* 📊 **Observability** → Micrometre, Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry
* 🗄️ **Persistence** → JPA, PostgreSQL, Redis

---

## 📖 Example Lifecycle

1. Base project = `soul-project`
2. Fork → `resilience4j-template`
3. Inside fork, branches:

   * `feature/circuit-breaker`
   * `feature/retry`
   * `feature/bulkhead`
4. Merge them back or keep them isolated as learning modules.

## 📈 Monitoring & Health

With **Spring Boot Actuator**:

* Health check: `http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`
* Metrics: `http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics`
